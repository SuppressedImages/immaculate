  <p><em>Suppressed Images: Picturing Chelsea Manning</em> is a comic-book illustration of a collaboration that took place between artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg and whistleblower Chelsea Manning in 2015. In the collaboration, titled <em>Radical Love</em>, Heather created portraits of Chelsea from DNA that she extracted from Chelsea’s hair clippings and cheek swabs.</p>

  <p><em>Suppressed Images: Picturing Chelsea Manning</em> goes behind the scenes to show details of the work’s process and ends with a speculative twist in which Chelsea Manning’s sentence is commuted, and she is released so that she can visit an exhibition of her portrait in person.</p>
